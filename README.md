# Ensemble is a remake of Spotify's website.

Overview:
  This project was our final part of the Google CSSI summer class. Me and my friend Marcus Posey.
 
 Backend:
    The backend was mainly developed by myself: Matthewos Gashaw.
  
  Frontend:
    The frontend was mainly developed by my partner: Marcus Posey.
    
 Final Notes:
    It was up and running at some point and succesfully let people listen to music (albeit one at a time). Due to lack of updates, firebase took it offline. This was only meant to display the knowlegde gained at the end of our time at Google CSSI.
